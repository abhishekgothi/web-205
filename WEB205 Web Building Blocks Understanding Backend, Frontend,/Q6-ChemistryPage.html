        <p>Buid the page given below using HTML. Use tags like h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6,p dfn, sub, var,sup,a,i,u,etc</p>
       
        <h2>Chemistry Assignment</h2>
        <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition and behaviour of matter. It is a facinating field that explores the building block of universe</p>
        
        <h3>Chemical Elements</h3>
        <p>The <mark>periodic table</mark> is a tabular arrangment of chemical elemnts Each elelment is represent by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for classifed into groups and periods based on their properties</p>
        
        <h4>Chemical Equations</h4>
        <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <i>chemical equations</i> Here's an example of a <i>chemical reaction:</i></p>
        <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> -> 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
        <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen has (H<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (O<sub>2</sub>) to form water (H<sub>2</sub>O).</p>
       
        <h5>Important Concepts</h5>
        <p><u>Stoichiometry</u> is the calculation of reatants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equation to ensure mass and charge are conserved. <sub>subscripts</sub> indicats the nuber of each elemnts in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts </sup> represent charge or the nuberof atoms in an ion.</p>
       
        <h6>Conclusion</h6>
       <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the compsotion of the air we breathe to the reaction that power our bodies, chemistry influces every aspect of our lives.</p>
